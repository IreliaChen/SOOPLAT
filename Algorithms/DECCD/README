This directory contains all the necessary files for running the 
DECC-D algorithm which is a cooperative co-evolutionary algorithm
that uses differential grouping for forming the subcomponents of 
the co-evolutionary framework. 
This program is tested with the CEC'2010 and is based on the 
following research paper:

Files and directories:
----------------------
 - benchmark        : this directory contains the necessary files for the
                      CEC'2010 benchmark problems.
 - decc.m           : this file is an implementation of a cooperative
                      co-evolutionary framework.
 - delta_grouping.m : this function implements the differential grouping
                      which is explained in full detail in the paper listed
                      above. This function called from decc.m
 - README           : this readme file.
 - result           : the experimental results are stored in this
                      directory. The recorded statistics are best of all runs,
                      mean, and standard deviation.
 - runcompe.m       : sets the search domain for different functions.
 - run.m            : this file can be used to run the DECC-D algorithm.
 - sansde.m         : the subcomponent optimizer based on SaNSDE.
 - trace            : this directory contains the intermediate results which
                      can be used for drawing convergence plots and further
                      analysis.
